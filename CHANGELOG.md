## [Unreleased]

## [2.0.0]
### Added
- Added Documentation
- Added this Changelog

### Changed
- Refactored the way how the system stores the current focus key and updates changed components. Before it was stored in Context which caused performance bottleneck when each component got updated to compare Context current focus key with the each component's focus key. Now it is stored only in Spatial Navigation service and only 2 components are updated by directly calling state handlers on them.

### Removed
- Removed Context

## [Older versions]
Changelog not maintained.
